		<h2>Unreal Engine</h2>
		<div class="blog">
		<p>In this assignment, I had to learn the basics of the Unreal Engine, developed by Epic. We had to follow a small tutorial that guided us through different processes of modeling, texturing and animating virtual objects in a virtual environment.</p><img src="../images/DifferentScreensUnity.jpg" alt=""/><img src="../images/BanaanImported&Textured.png" alt=""/> <p>After importing the prebuild mesh, a different word for model, I had to texture it first. First I had to add an material and select a picture to be used as an texture. After that I had to select the model of the banana again, to add the material I just created to be used as an texture. See the following figure</p><p>Last thing that needed to be done, was the animation. Luckily for me, this was very easy to do. I had to add a trigger and an event to make the banana rotate. In the figure on the right you can see a red box called 'Event Tick'. In unity time is displayed in ticks and this basically is Unity language for 'every second'. The blue box called 'AddLocalRotation' does exactly what it says it does. Adds a rotation to the object, I set the Z value to 1. This makes this model rotate 1 degree in the Z-axis. Link it up with the 'Event Tick' and voila!</p><img src="../images/Eventgraph banana.png" alt=""/><h3>End result</h3><img src="../images/BananaTurnFinished.gif" alt=""/></div>
